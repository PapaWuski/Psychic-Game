# Psychic-Game

The site will generate a random letter.
The user will have 10 attempts to guess what letter was selected.
The site will alert the user if they attempt to reuse a letter that has already been guessed.
The site will only accept alphabetical letters.
The site will also track which games you win/lose on the side.

If you are having trouble winning, opening the javascript console will show the current letter that the computer has selected.
